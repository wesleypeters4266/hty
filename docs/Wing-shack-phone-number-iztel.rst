Delivery & Pickup Options - 2 reviews of Wing Shack Johnstown "Nice little wing joint! Hugely busy right now cause it just opened so expect a bit of a wait. Could not get the app to work yet and seating was limited but again they just opened and are full! Pretty good selection of wing sauces and sides. I really liked the buffalo bbq sauce.3/5(2). Wing Shack JOHNSTOWN NOW OPEN! We are excited to open our 9th Wing Shack location, located in historic downtown Johnstown Colorado at 21 North Parish Ave. Our new location will feature a historic dining room, our signature hot wings, and four new exclusive Wing Shack drinks: Shack Beer, an American lager, which will be available at all Wing Missing: phone number. 8/18/ 1 photo. Food was ok. Everything was piping hot and fresh, so there are no complaints there. I ordered 12 wings with rice and an egg roll. The wings were huge in size, but were breaded and once the sauce was added, were a little too soggy for my liking.4/5(37).
