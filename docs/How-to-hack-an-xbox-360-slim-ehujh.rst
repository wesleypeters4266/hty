Turn on your Xbox Insert the USB stick into a free USB port on the console‚Äôs front or rear. Select ‚ÄúJTAG‚Äù from the main menu and insert your USB stick into the computer USB slot. The program will detect it automatically and ask you if you want to format it for use with an Xbox  ¬†¬∑ Currently all Phat 's are hackable. Most of the older ones can be dumped without a PMT (Probe 3) Liteons need a Probe 3 to retrieve the DVD key from. Slim 's are hackable but require either a replacement PCB (expensive), a small hardware hack or a risky hack that involves drilling into the controller chip. All Slim drives can be "flashed". ¬†¬∑ just a quick video tutorial to show you how to carry on hacking with your new xbox console hope it helps remember to subcribe LINK TO CABLES:http://www.a.
